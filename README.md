## Lab 3.1: Working with Amazon S3
### Lab overview and objectives
In this lab, you use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to host a static website. You will also implement architectural best practices to protect and manage your data.

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

* Create a static website by using Amazon S3.
* Apply a bucket policy on an S3 bucket to configure customized data protection.
* Upload objects to an S3 bucket by using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
* Configure the website that is hosted on Amazon S3 to be accessible only from a specific IP address range, and test the configuration.
